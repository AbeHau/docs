Registration can be required for Users to create tickets on the Help Desk to prevent random tickets or to limit Usersâ€™ accessibility to the help desk.

If Registration is required, there are a few options of registration methods for end-users.

Registration is an important feature for Users to check ticket statuses or see all of their tickets in the help desk. A User can follow the link in the auto response to check the status of a ticket, or they can Login to the client portal to a ticket with the ticket number and their email address. This will then send a link to their email for them to follow back to that one, singular ticket. A User must be registered to Login to view all tickets associated with their name.

Users can easily check the status of a ticket with their email address and a ticket number if the Click Quick Access box is unchecked.
