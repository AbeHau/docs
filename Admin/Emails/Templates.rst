OsTicket contains stock messages that are sent out to both Agents and End Users during specific events of a ticketâ€™s life cycle. These email message templates can be edited, disabled globally or locally, as well as cloned and assigned to different Departments. When editing, the messages in the templates each have an HTML/Rich Text toolbar for design and brand flexibility.

All templates can include variables which will automatically pull that information (if available) from a submitted ticket.

The entire set of email templates can be cloned for use and assigned to a specific Department of the Help Desk. This is especially useful if the messages need to be different for tickets assigned to the Department.
