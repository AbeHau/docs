Meant to be a historical marker of the metadata in your help desk, the Dashboard will give you an overview of tickets in your help desk. The data can be filtered by date as well as Departments, Help Topics, and Agents. This data can also be exported into a CSV file.

**Opened:** In this category, this is the number of tickets opened by agent (internally) and not by external customers. The circles in each category are a quick visual way to determine the number values in the columns. The larger the circle, the larger the number.

**Assigned:** Tickets can be auto-assigned to certain departments and/or agent based on your set up of emails and filters. Tickets can also be assigned internally to other agent/departments. The system tracks each time the ticket is assigned. The colored circles signify the same as above.

**Overdue:** This column refers to tickets that have gone over the SLA (Service Level Agreement) which you can set in Admin Panel > Manage > SLA Plans. You can set different SLA times for each department.

**Closed:** This column tells you the number of tickets closed by each Agent. Tickets can be closed three ways:

  **A.** Go to the ticket listing page, highlight the selected ticket by checking the box on the far left side of the screen. Once the ticket(s) are selected, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the "close" button in the middle. A pop-up box will appear to ask about closing the selected tickets. Press "Yes" to continue to close the tickets.

  **B.** A ticket can be closed when clicking on the ticket to view the contents of the ticket- this will not send a notification to the sender. At the top right of the ticket screen, there will be buttons including "close". When pressed, a dialogue box will pop-up asking for internal documentation of why the ticket is being closed. Although not required to close the ticket, it is highly recommended.

  **C.** A ticket can also be closed under the "Post Internal Note" tab at the bottom of a ticket. In order to close a ticket in this manner, you must include an internal note then change the "Ticket Status" for that ticket to "closed."

**Reopened:** Tickets can be reopened in two ways:

  **A.** A customer can respond to a ticket that agent has closed internally.

  **B.** Select and click on a "closed" ticket > (scroll to the bottom of the ticket ) > Post Internal Note > Change Ticket status.

**Service Time:** This is the length in days between the time the ticket was created and when the ticket was closed by an Agent.

**Response Time:** This is the length in days between the time the ticket was created and the Agent responded/replied to the customer.
