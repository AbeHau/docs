Post-Install Setup Guide
========================

Once osTicket has been installed you need to further configure it via admin panel before it is fully usable. Only staff with admin's privileges can access the admin panel. Please use the username and password created during the install process.

Email Setup
-----------

Setting up your system to accept emails varies from system to system and your personal preference. osTicket allows you to route unlimited number of emails as incoming tickets. For detailed instruction please see :doc:`Email Settings Guide <Email Settings>`.

Help Topics
-----------

In addition to emails, clients/users can also use an online form to create tickets. Help topics helps maps online inquiries to a department and assigns priority without the need for the user to select a department or/and ticket priority. This gives you ability to route inquiries without exposing internal departments.

Departments
-----------

Departments are used to categorize incoming tickets and also as access mask for staff members. For example you can restrict staff's tickets access based on departments. To manage departments go to the **Departments** tab in the **Admin Panel**.

Staff Members
-------------

osTicket allows you to add unlimited number of representatives to the system. Each staff member is assigned to a group and a department which determines the level of permission. Every staff account can be of type 'Admin' or 'Staff'.

System Preferences
------------------

To disable or change system settings, go to Settings Tab in **Admin Panel**.
