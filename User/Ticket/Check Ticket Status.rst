Check Ticket Status
===================

Using Email Address & Ticket Number
-----------------------------------

To check a ticket status, visit the main page of the help desk just as when you opened the ticket. You will select one of the two “Check Ticket Status” buttons.

With User Account
-----------------

Another way to check the status of a ticket is to log in directly to the system to access all of your tickets. In order to do this, you will need to create a user account by clicking on register for an account.

The benefit of creating a user account is that all tickets associated with your account will be listed in the ticket queue.
