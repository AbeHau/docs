Require Help Topic
==================

Admins now have the option to require a Help Topic before a Ticket can be closed.

By default, this setting is NOT enabled.

To enable this setting, go to:

Admin Panel | Settings | Tickets | Require Help Topic to Close

.. image:: ../_static/images/require_ht_setting.png
  :alt: Require Help Topic

If enabled, Tickets without a Help Topic will have a warning banner across the bottom of the page, a warning when trying to change the Ticket status to Closed, and a warning flag beside the Help Topic field when editing the Ticket.
