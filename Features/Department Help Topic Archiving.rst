Archiving Departments and Help Topics
=====================================

Occasionally it could become necessary to no longer use certain Departments or Help Topics within a helpdesk. Even though they will no longer be used in the future, there could be some Tickets that are still assigned to the Department or Help Topic. In addition, there are important Dashboard Statistics already stored. To resolve these issues, Admins may now choose to Archive Departments or Help Topics.

Departments:
-------------

Departments can have a status of Active, Archived, or Disabled.

**Active** departments can be selected for new tickets and used throughout the system as usual.

**Archived** departments may not be chosen for any new tickets. If a closed ticket receives a response from a user and has an Archived department, a new ticket will be opened referencing the ticket’s old title and number. It will have the System Default chosen as the Department.

User response to the Closed ticket:

  :alt: Closed Archived Department Response

A new ticket is now opened referencing the ticket’s old title and number if a User replies by email to the closed ticket.

**Disabled** departments may not be chosen for any new tickets either, however, if a closed ticket receives a response, the system will reopen the ticket.

Closed ticket in Disabled Department:

User response to the Closed ticket:

Help Topics:

A new ticket is now opened referencing the ticket’s old title and number.
